  title = {A Quantization Strategy for Communication-Efficient DNN Inference in Vehicular Edge Computing},
  note = {Submitted to Design Automation Conference (DAC)},
  abstract = {As Deep Neural Network (DNN) applications drive the development of intelligent connected vehicles (ICV), there is a clear need for efficient and reliable DNN processing in ICVs. Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm to meet such demand, where vehicles can cooperate to perform computation tasks. However, there is currently a mismatch between vehicles’ communication capacities and computation capacities, making the communication channel a scarce resource for DNN inference workloads. This paper proposes a design-time deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based quantization strategy to alleviate this issue under dynamic communication and computing environments in VEC while complying with a pre-defined accuracy drop constraint. Compared to greedy strategies, our results show significant improvements in communication traffic and inference latency.},

  abstract={Analog Non-Volatile Memory-based accelerators offer high-throughput and energy-efficient Multiply-Accumulate operations for the large Fully-Connected layers that dominate Transformer-based Large Language Models. We describe architectural, wafer-scale testing, chip-demo, and hardware-aware training efforts towards such accelerators, and quantify the unique raw-throughput and latency benefits of Fully- (rather than Partially-)Weight-Stationary systems.},
