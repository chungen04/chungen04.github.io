I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering, minor Computer Science in [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) (NTU). Currently, I am working with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/) and [Skymizer Inc.](https://skymizer.com/) on efficient ML serving and design. Previously, I am also fortunate to join [IBM Research Almaden](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) as an intern, mentored by [Dr. Geoffrey Burr](https://research.ibm.com/people/geoffrey-burr) and [Dr. HsinYu (Sidney) Tsai](https://research.ibm.com/people/sidney-tsai), and advised by [Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=65), on the topic of Compute-In-Memory (CIM) for ML acceleration.

My research interest is about efficient ML serving, particularly hardware-efficient algorithms and systems design. My previous research includes interdisplinary topics in efficient ML serving design, including throughput-efficient inference on hardware, CIM architecture, and safety-oriented dynamic quantization.

I love hiking and nature. The best places I have been to in my life are Hehuan, Taiwan; Lake Tahoe, US; Zugspitze and KÃ¶nigssee, Germany.
