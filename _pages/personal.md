## Extracurricular & Leadership
- **Epoch Foundation** During my undergraduate years, I participated in non-profit organizations in Taiwan. I enjoyed my time at [Epoch Foundation](https://epoch.org.tw/en), where I got to explore the exciting intersection between cutting-edge research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and real-world industry needs in Taiwan. As an MIT–Taiwan Industrial Cooperation Research Intern, I followed updates from MIT CSAIL and MIT-ILP, and helped keep 30+ Taiwanese companies in the loop with relevant insights and collaboration opportunities. It was a great chance to bridge research and industry, and to get a behind-the-scenes look at how global innovation partnerships take shape.
- **NTUEE+** [NTUEE+](https://eeplus.ntuee.org) is part of NTUEE Student Association, hosting overseas alumni connection services with undergraduate students. I was a co-director of the organization during 2022-2023.

## Writing
I enjoy writing on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@chungen04) for personal thoughts, experiences, and reading notes. Some articles were written in Mandarin.

## Personal Life
Born and raised in Taiwan, where high mountains are dense throughout the island, I enjoy high-altitude hiking. Currently, I continue seeking hiking opportunities and experiences in the United States.
