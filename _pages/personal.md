## Extracurricular
During my undergraduate years, I participated in non-profit organizations in Taiwan. I enjoyed my time at [Epoch Foundation](https://epoch.org.tw/en), where I got to explore the exciting intersection between cutting-edge research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and real-world industry needs in Taiwan. As an MITâ€“Taiwan Industrial Cooperation Research Intern, I followed updates from MIT CSAIL and MIT-ILP, and helped keep 30+ Taiwanese companies in the loop with relevant insights and collaboration opportunities. It was a great chance to bridge research and industry, and to get a behind-the-scenes look at how global innovation partnerships take shape.

## Personal Life
Born and raised in Taiwan, where high mountains are dense throughout the island, I enjoy high-altitude hiking. Here is a list of summits I have been to on the [100 Peaks of Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Peaks_of_Taiwan):
